Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}

If you're developing and building container images locally, don't forget to use:

  $ eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

Otherwise your images won't be built inside minikube Docker, e.g. k8s won't be able to reach it

To connect to the cluster, try:

  $ minikube ip
  $ kubectl get service {{ .Release.Name }} -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="api")].nodePort}'
  $ make client
