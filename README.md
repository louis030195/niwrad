## Dependencies

* Online mode: [Nakama](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama)
* Online mode: <https://github.com/louis030195/octree>
* Online mode: deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, Helm)
* Both: Unitask, Protobuf, TextMesh Pro, new unity input system, few free assets

## Goals

* Hosts have characteristics. When hosts reproduce sexually or asexually, the offspring characteristics are its parent's plus mutations.
* Hosts behaviour code MUST be generic, so we can either implement simple heuristics like state-machines, behaviour trees, utility or try learning AI like reinforcement learning.
* Observers can trigger artificial selection, the goal is to implement actions that offer the possibility to influence evolution. Currently what came to my mind: any way to protect, harm, heal, feed ... some species

## Non-goals

* Simulating nature at the quantum level
