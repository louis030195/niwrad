To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ Release.Namespace }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ Release.Namespace }}
  $ kubectl logs -f deployment/{{.Release.Name }} -n {{ Release.Namespace }}

If you're developing with Minikube (or other k8s-in-container) and building container images locally, don't forget to use:

  $ eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

Otherwise your images won't be built inside Minikube Docker, e.g. k8s won't be able to pull it

To connect to the cluster, try:

  $ minikube ip
  $ kubectl get service {{ .Release.Name }} -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="api")].nodePort}'
  $ make client

To get logs from the executors, try:

  $ kubectl logs -f -l tier=executor -n {{ Release.Namespace }}
